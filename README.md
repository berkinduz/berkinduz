HI! In the first years of my university education,
I was involved in charity organizations such as Greenpeace, </br> and I worked as a manager in communities such as the Computer Society (IEEE).</br> 
In the following years, I started Robotics-Computer Courses for children in disadvantaged regions. </br> 
I'm an experienced Robotic programming instruction with more than 2500 students.</br> 
Then, by joining Robotime, I improved my education field and quality with leading Maker products, especially LEGO.</br> 
After 8 months of teaching, I took over the General Coordinatorship within Robotime.</br> 
During this period, I had meetings with many new schools and companies. </br> 
While I was working as a coordinator, I consulted some high schools in robotic competitions and helped them get degrees in these competitions. </br> 
I coached my team with Robotime, which was preparing for LEGO's international Robotics tournament, FLL. </br> 
Then I focused on finishing my school. I passed all the exams and graduated.</br>
In this process, I started to learn the field of Web Development.</br>
I'm thinking of doing my career planning on Web Development. I am currently continuing my education on this subject. </br>
Apart from that, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence topics also attract my attention. I have worked on this before. </br>

<b>On Github, I share the projects I made during my Web Development trainings. For now. :)</b><br>
